# 🌀 Manual Rotation + Projection Demo

A simple yet educational OpenGL-based demo focused on **understanding 3D rotation and projection** by implementing the math manually — without relying on external math libraries like GLM.

This project is built to strengthen low-level graphics programming fundamentals through hands-on matrix and vector math.

---

## 🚧 Current Progress

### 🧮 `Mathlib`
A lightweight custom math library under development for:
- Vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot, cross, normalization)
- Basic matrix operations (under construction)
- Manual transformations (rotation, scaling, translation — upcoming)

> The goal is to fully implement vector and matrix operations **from scratch**, as a learning exercise.

### 🧠 `main.cpp`
This will soon include:
- Manual implementation of rotation and projection transformations
- Visualization using OpenGL (GLAD + GLFW)
- Step-by-step rendering of a rotating 3D object
