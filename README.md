# 🌀 Manual Rotation + Projection Demo

A complete OpenGL-based demo focused on **understanding 3D rotation and projection** by implementing all core math manually — without using external libraries like GLM.

This project was built to strengthen low-level graphics programming fundamentals through hands-on matrix and vector operations.

## ✅ Project Status

This project is **now complete** 🎉  

It demonstrates:
- Manual rotation and projection transformations  
- Custom vector and matrix math for 3D transformations  
- Rendering a rotating 3D object using **OpenGL (GLAD + GLFW)**  

All core goals of this demo have been achieved.

## 🧮 Math Library (Now in Separate Repository)

The custom math library (`Mathlib`) developed for this project is now being **maintained separately** as its own standalone OpenGL mathematics library.  
It focuses on building a complete math framework for graphics programming — including vectors, matrices, transformations, and more.

> 🔗 You can find ongoing Mathlib updates in its dedicated repository.
